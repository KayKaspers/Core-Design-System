# Core Design System — Project Brain

Compact long-term orientation for the Core Design System (CDS). This document
summarizes; it does not duplicate the normative documents it points to.

- **Project:** Core Design System (CDS)
- **Repository:** KayKaspers/Core-Design-System
- **Local path:** `D:\Projects\Core-Design-System`
- **Framework:** Nova Development Framework v1.0.0
- **Phase:** Foundation / Pre-Design

## Strategic purpose

CDS is the central design and brand foundation for the Core ecosystem — a
versioned platform product providing a normative Single Source of Truth.

Its long-term scope reaches well beyond UI components: brand strategy,
corporate identity, corporate design, design principles, UX, UI, components,
design tokens, colors, typography, icons, logos, GitHub presentation, document
design, PDF layouts, presentations, diagram standards, dashboards,
accessibility, motion, marketing materials, and product-family governance.

That scope is long-term. It does not authorize concrete work in any of those
areas today.

## Core principles

- CDS is a versioned platform product, not a logo project, branding kit, or
  isolated component library.
- CDS must be usable by real Core products.
- Normative sources must not depend solely on a proprietary design tool.
- Normative sources and generated artifacts must stay clearly separated.
- Generated output is never an authoritative source.
- Design decisions must be versioned, documented, reviewable, and testable.
- Accessibility is designed in rather than added later.
- Offline and self-hosted usability are core requirements.
- Product individuality must be controlled and governable.
- AI may assist; normative approval remains human.
- Concrete visual and technical decisions come only from explicitly authorized
  work packages.

## Roles

| Role | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Human Maintainer (Kay) | Final normative approvals; exclusive Git-write, tag, release, publication, and repository-visibility authority. |
| Nova | Strategy, architecture, work-package planning, review, project control, approval recommendations. |
| Claude | Scoped local analysis and file work only; no Git writes, no publication. |
| Consumer projects | Requirements input and adoption evidence. |

## Current state

Governance foundation established. No final design or technology decisions are
approved.

- Decisions: DEC-S-001 … DEC-S-006 (6) — all strategic foundation decisions
- Risks: RISK-001 … RISK-005 (5)
- Completed work package: CDS-WP-001
- Next work package: CDS-WP-001A

## Decisions in force

| ID | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| DEC-S-001 | CDS is a versioned platform product and normative design foundation. |
| DEC-S-002 | CoreOps is the first reference consumer, not the sole target or requirement source. |
| DEC-S-003 | Governance, scope, architecture, and requirements precede concrete design decisions. |
| DEC-S-004 | Normative sources must remain tool-independent; no proprietary tool as sole source of truth. |
| DEC-S-005 | Human Maintainer holds exclusive authority over Git writes, releases, publication, and approvals. |
| DEC-S-006 | Artifacts and consumer usage must support offline and self-hosted operation. |

## Active risks

| ID | Summary | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RISK-001 | Uncontrolled scope expansion. | Monitored |
| RISK-002 | CoreOps overfitting. | Monitored |
| RISK-003 | Premature design decisions. | Monitored |
| RISK-004 | Tool lock-in and source divergence. | Monitored |
| RISK-005 | Design, code, and documentation drift. | Monitored |

Details: [Risk Register](../docs/risks/RISK_REGISTER.md)

## Intentionally open decisions

No final decision exists for: logo, logo architecture, colors, typography,
icons, illustration, imagery, dark theme, light theme, design tool, component
framework, token format, token build system, documentation platform, package
architecture, repository split, license, public release, contribution model,
long-term compatibility commitments, or concrete product signatures.

## Pilot consumer

CoreOps is the first reference consumer of stable CDS foundations. It provides
adoption evidence and real-world validation. It is explicitly not the sole
design target and not the sole source of requirements. SpeakCore, CastCore,
AirCore, and future Core products are anticipated consumers; inclusion does not
by itself authorize full brand adoption.

## Next step

CDS-WP-001A — NDF Skills Bootstrap: controlled adoption and verification of the
approved NDF v1.0.0 Skills, without modifying their normative upstream content
and without any visual design decisions. Requires an explicit work-package
prompt from Nova.
